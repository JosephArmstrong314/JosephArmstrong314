# Projects:

## Nutrition Tool | Web App

For the Convex 2024 Hackathon, I joined a team of hackers to create a web-based search tool for nutrition data from USDA datasets. My role primarily included accessing the raw USDA data, processing it with Python, loading it into the Convex database, and then writing Convex database queries in TypeScript to trigger on events from the Front End. The data was downloaded from the USDA website here: [USDA Nutrition Data](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). Opting to download the data in the JSON format, I used Python to explore, parse, and clean the data from 3.5 GB to only 170 MB, allowing the data to fit within the Convex database capacity. Afterwards, I configured Convex, Vercel, Node.js, and React to all work together. Finally, I implemented Convex queries to establish connectivity between the Front End and the Back End. The web app, deployed on Vercel, is here: [Nutrition App](https://convex-nutriiton.vercel.app/). Here is the github repo for the Data Pipeline: [USDA FDC ETL](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/usda-fdc-etl/tree/main). Here is the github repo for the Front End: [GitHub Front End](https://github.com/mashiourcse/convex_nutriiton).

## Teleformer | Unity 2D Videogame

For my CS148 project course, I worked with a team of 7 CS students to develop a 2D puzzle platformer in Unity. This game requries players to solve puzzles using telekinetic powers to link objects to other objects or the player. This project won the Audience Choice Award, and my contributions to the team included Team Management, Git/GitHub Expert, Agile/Scrum Master, UI Development, and Game Designer. Having the most experience on the team, it was my priviledge to teach the rest of my teammates proper Git/GitHub protocols to maximize code organization, minimize merge conflicts, maintain an organized Kanban board, and facilitate a professional CI/CD pipeline. I had a phenomenal experience with my team Agile operations, including daily Standups, Scrum meetings, Sprint Planning, and Retrospectives. I wish to work with more teams like that in my career. Our game is available on itch.io: [Teleformer](https://qiruhu.itch.io/teleformer). Here is a snippet of our GitHub repo that I imported: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/Teleformer/tree/main).

# Experience

## Computer Science Tutor

Since Spring of 2024, I've been tutoring students in C++, Java, Python, Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and AI. I aid the student with homework, projects, exam prep, and customized practice material.

## Undergradute Learning Assistant

For my Spring 2020 quarter at UC Santa Barbara, I was an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for the *CMPSC24: Problem Solving with C++* course under Professor Diba Mirza. My responsibilities included monitoring synchronous Zoom lectures, grading weekly assignments and quizzes, holding office hours, and leading class discussions and labs.
