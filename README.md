# Projects:

## Analytics Dashboard | Web App

For Tableau's 2023 - 2024 DataDev Hackathon, I teamed up with a Front-End Dev, a Data Analyst, and a UI/UX Designer to construct a proof-of-concept analytics dashboard for a LinkTree-like web app. My role: Back-End Engineer. My job was to design, implement, and integrate a REST API to store analytic data from users visiting our web page. I did this using the Flask framework in Python, connected to a MySQL database, all hosted on pythonanywhere.com. I also tested my API using Postman. After the back-end was complete, I moved on to exploring the Tableau API in order to embed our dashboard within our web page. In this project, I learned Flask, SQLAlchemy, React, Tableau Embedding API, and Postman. The website can be viewed here: [Website](https://jovoight.github.io/tableauhackathon). The front-end code can be viewed here: [Front-End](https://github.com/jovoight/tableauhackathon). The back-end code can be viewed here: [Back-End](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/tableauhackathon-linktree-backend). 

## Teleformer | Unity 2D Videogame

For my CS148 project course, I worked with a team of 7 CS students to develop a 2D puzzle platformer in Unity. This game requries players to solve puzzles using telekinetic powers to link objects to other objects or the player. This project won the Audience Choice Award, and my contributions to the team included Team Management, Git/GitHub Expert, Agile/Scrum Master, UI Development, and Game Designer. Having the most experience on the team, it was my priviledge to teach the rest of my teammates proper Git/GitHub protocols to maximize code organization, minimize merge conflicts, maintain an organized Kanban board, and facilitate a professional CI/CD pipeline. I had a phenomenal experience with my team Agile operations, including daily Standups, Scrum meetings, Sprint Planning, and Retrospectives. I wish to work with more teams like that in my career. Our game is available on itch.io: [Teleformer](https://qiruhu.itch.io/teleformer). Here is a snippet of our GitHub repo that I imported: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/Teleformer/tree/main).

## Pathfinder | Web App

This is an ongoing project where I develop a visualization tool for search algorithms. Built in React, this tool allows the user to place walls, resize the grid, and visualize the search algorithm. The tool is available here: [Pathfinder](https://josepharmstrong314.github.io/Pathfinder/), and here is the GitHub repo: [GitHub Project}(https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/Pathfinder)

# Experience
