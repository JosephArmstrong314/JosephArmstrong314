# Projects:

## Tableau Analytics for LinkTree | Web App

For Tableau's 2023 - 2024 DataDev Hackathon, I teamed up with a Front-End Dev, a Data Analyst, and a UI/UX Designer to construct a proof-of-concept analytics dashboard for LinkTree. My role: Back-End Engineer. My job was to design, implement, and integrate an REST API to store analytic data from users visiting our LinkTree clone. I did this using the Flask framework in Python, connected to a MySQL database, all hosted on pythonanywhere.com. I also tested my API using Postman. After the back-end was complete, I moved on to exploring the Tableau API in order to embed out dashboard within our web page. In this project, I learned Flask, SQLAlchemy, React, Tableau Embedding API, and Postman. The website can be viewed here: [Website](https://jovoight.github.io/tableauhackathon). The front-end code can be viewed here: [Front-End](https://github.com/jovoight/tableauhackathon). The back-end code can be viewed here: [Back-End](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/tableauhackathon-linktree-backend).

## Teleformer | Unity 2D Videogame

For my CS148 project course, I worked with a team of 7 CS students to develop a 2D puzzle platformer in Unity. This game requries players players to solve puzzles using telekinetic powers to link the objects to other objects as well as the player. My contributions to the team include: Team Management, Git/GitHub Operations, Agile/Scrum Master, UI Development, Game Design, and Lead Project Architect. Having the most experience on the team, it was my priviledge to teach the rest of my team proper Git/GitHub protocol to maximize code organization, minimize merge conflicts, maintain an organized Kanban board, and facilitate a professional CI/CD pipeline. I also made sure the project followed industry standards regarding the object-oriented design of code modules and file structure. My team was truly professional and phenomenal during Agile operations, including daily Standups, Scrum meetings, Sprint Planning, and Retrospectives. I wish to work with more teams like that in mym career. Our game is available on itch.io: [Teleformer](https://qiruhu.itch.io/teleformer). Here is a snippet of our GitHub repo that I imported: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/Teleformer/tree/main).

## Jeopardy | Web App

This was a small project tutorial to get me started with Web Development, utilizing the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skeleton of many Web Applications. I will take these skills and improve onwards to a Personal Website built in React. Here is the website: [Jeopardy Game](https://josepharmstrong314.github.io/jeopardy-tutorial/), and here is the GitHub Repo: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/jeopardy-tutorial).

## Hotel Sentiment Analyzer | Web Scraper

For the 2023 CitrusHack at the University of California - Riverside, I teamed up with 3 other CS students to develop a Google Extension for analyzing hotel reviews. My role was to develop a Web Scraper that goes through hotel reviews on Yelp and analyze the sentiment value of the comments. In this project, I learned a variety of Python libraries, most notably BeautifulSoup4. Here is the GitHub Repo: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/JosephArmstrong314/Hotel-Reviews_Web-Scraper/tree/main).

# Experience
